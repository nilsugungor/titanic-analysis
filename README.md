# titanic-analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that predicts Titanic passenger survival using Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
## Features
- Handles missing values (Age, Fare, Embarked)
- Feature engineering: FamilySize, AgeGroup
- Categorical encoding (Sex, Embarked, AgeGroup)
- Logistic Regression (with scaling)
- Random Forest (no scaling required)
## Results
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: ~81.6%
- Random Forest Accuracy: ~83.8%
